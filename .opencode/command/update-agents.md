Review the current AGENTS.md file (@AGENTS.md) and update it with new insights learned during this session.

Analyze what was discovered while working with the codebase and intelligently integrate new knowledge by:
- Adding new bullet points to existing sections where appropriate
- Creating new sections for entirely new topics
- Enhancing existing descriptions with more specific details
- Adding new patterns, conventions, or best practices discovered
- Including solutions to problems that were solved
- Updating any outdated information

Focus on practical, actionable insights that will help future development sessions. The goal is to make AGENTS.md a comprehensive, living document that evolves with the project.

Rewrite the entire file with improvements while maintaining the existing structure and preserving all valuable current information.
